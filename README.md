# INTELLIGENT RECRUITZ SYSTEM



# Problem Statement

As a candidate, it is difficult to know how the personality and skills align with the requirements of a job. You may have the skills and experience for a job, but if your personality is not a good fit for the company culture, you may not be successful.
Traditional methods of personality assessment, such as interviews and personality tests, can be subjective and inaccurate. This can lead to candidates being passed over for jobs that they would be well-suited for.
The traditional methods of mock test , etc., costs very much to the candidates, and also they are not satisfied by their works.
There is a need of an AI based solution, that assess the candidates about the required skills for the job and provide with accurate result and personalized suggestions based on the result.


# Proposed Solution

Recruitz is an AI-powered personality assessment platform that provides candidates with a score based on their personality traits and suitability for a particular job.
This uses a variety of data sources, such as images, videos, and audio recordings, to assess personality.
Recruitz would also be able to take into account the context of the situation, such as the job role and provide candidates with a score that would indicate their suitability for a particular job.
The assessment score is provided with features like eye-tracking, boldness,  professionality of the candidate, and the truthiness of the answer provided by the candidate during assessment using their facial expressions with the help of Machine Learning.
This score would be based on a number of factors, including the candidate's personality traits, skills, and experience.
The presented score will be in a clear and easy-to-understand format, so that candidates can easily see how their personality and skills align with the requirements of the job.
Suggestions also provided to the candidate by using Generative AI based on the score and the area where they lack.
